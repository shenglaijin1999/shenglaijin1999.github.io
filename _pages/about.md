Welcome to my homepage!  
I am **Shenglai Jin**, a researcher devoted to exploring the pathways of **energy transition and sustainable mobility**.  
My academic background lies in *Sustainable Electric Power Engineering and Electromobility* at **Chalmers University of Technology**, with additional exchange experience at the **Technical University of Munich**.  
My work focuses on the integration of **electric vehicles, renewable energy, and power systems**, aiming to enhance system flexibility and resilience through interdisciplinary modeling.
My research interests center on **vehicle-to-grid (V2G) integration**, **energy system optimization**, and **multi-objective decision-making** for sustainable infrastructure.  
I am passionate about understanding how technological innovation, environmental science, and human behavior can be combined to support a cleaner and more efficient energy future.

Outside research, I enjoy immersing myself in nature and discovering new cultures. Those experiences continually broaden my perspective and inspire creative thinking in my academic work.  

**Research Interests:**  
- Energy transition and sustainability  
- Electric vehicle and grid integration (V2G)  
- Transportâ€“energy coupling and flexibility modeling  
- Multi-energy systems and optimization
