Welcome to my homepage!  
I’m **Shenglai Jin**, a researcher devoted to advancing the transformation of energy and mobility systems toward sustainability.  
My academic background spans *Electrical Engineering* and *Sustainable Electric Power Engineering & Electromobility* at **Chalmers University of Technology**, with exchange experience at the **Technical University of Munich**.  
My work focuses on the intersection of **electric vehicles**, **renewable energy**, and **power system optimization** — aiming to enhance flexibility, resilience, and efficiency in future low-carbon infrastructures.  

> “Technology connects systems, but curiosity connects people and the planet.”

Beyond research, I enjoy hiking, exploring natural landscapes, and immersing myself in diverse cultures that continually broaden my view of sustainability and life.

> “Every meaningful research journey is also a journey through life.”
