# 💼 Work Experience

---

## 🏅 Delegation Attaché, Swedish University Sports Federation (FISU)  
*Apr 2025 – Jul 2025, Reine-Rhur, Germany*  

Working with Swedish team at the World University Games was less about logistics and more about learning the rhythm of teamwork beyond language and culture. Coordinating schedules, interpreting between officials, and managing on-site communication revealed how patience and empathy can make a system work as smoothly as any technical design. It was a reminder that organization is not about control but about connection.

## 🌍 Intern, World Federation of United Nations Associations (WFUNA)  
*Jun 2023 – Aug 2023, Geneva, Switzerland*  

At the United Nations, I learned that words can move as much energy as electrons. Drafting speeches and writing sustainability reports required precision not of numbers, but of narratives. Working within the SDG framework gave me a firsthand look at how global policies are translated into local action, and how energy transition is ultimately a story about people’s choices and shared responsibilities.

## 🏫 Office Administration, Beijing Jiaotong University  
*Jun 2021 – Jul 2022, Beijing, China*  

Serving as a counselor after graduation transformed my understanding of education and leadership. I managed student organizations, coordinated cultural events, and supported art education programs. Behind each administrative task was a moment of mentorship, listening, guiding, and learning from others’ growth. It was my first encounter with managing a community, where soft skills proved as valuable as any technical expertise.

## ⚙️ Trainee Engineer, Beijing Feb. 7th Locomotive Industries Co., Ltd.  
*Sep 2020 – Dec 2020, Beijing, China*  

In the workshop, theory met steel. Drafting in CAD and assembling machinery exposed me to the tactile side of engineering, the smell of oil, the sound of tools, the patience of precision. That experience grounded me, showing that innovation begins with respect for the fundamentals of design and craftsmanship.
