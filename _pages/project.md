*A selection of projects that shaped my understanding of energy systems, technology, and interdisciplinary research.*

## 🚗 Swedish Transport Electrification and Grid Impact  
*2024–2025, Chalmers University of Technology*  

This project explored how large-scale electrification interacts with Sweden’s existing power grid. I developed traffic-flow and travel-behavior models using machine learning to estimate energy demand for urban commuting and highway travel. A multi-criteria optimization framework was applied to determine suitable charging locations under technical and policy constraints. Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, I assessed grid flexibility and energy-market implications. Beyond the data and algorithms, the work reshaped my understanding of electrification as both an engineering and social process, where human mobility patterns intertwine with power dynamics.

## 📊 Computational Electromagnetics  
*2023, Chalmers University of Technology*  

Using COMSOL Multiphysics, I performed simulations combining thermal, electrical, and mechanical fields to study complex electromagnetic environments. The challenge lay in achieving numerical stability while keeping models physically realistic. Translating theoretical equations into visual field distributions gave me an intuitive sense of how energy behaves within constrained materials. It was a vivid reminder that engineering precision and creativity can coexist in solving real-world problems.

## ⚡ High-Voltage Testing Project  
*2023, Chalmers University of Technology*  

Working in the high-voltage laboratory, I conducted impulse generation and insulation breakdown tests using voltage dividers and sphere-gap techniques. The project required both technical accuracy and absolute respect for safety. Observing waveforms that revealed the threshold between normal operation and failure deepened my appreciation for the limits of materials. It also strengthened my attention to detail and my ability to remain composed under high-risk experimental conditions.

## 🔋 Modeling and Experimentation of Li-ion Batteries  
*2022–2023, Chalmers University of Technology*  

In this study, I used COMSOL to simulate the electro-thermal behavior of lithium-ion batteries under varying loads, complemented by laboratory fabrication and testing of individual cells. The integration of simulation and experiment taught me that data from physical systems rarely aligns perfectly with theoretical expectations. Bridging this gap required patience, systematic calibration, and critical evaluation. This experience grounded my understanding of how modeling accuracy depends on experimental awareness.

## 🧠 Brain–Computer Interface System  
*2021, Beijing Jiaotong University*  

This undergraduate research project involved analyzing EEG signals to extract SSVEP features and building a prototype trolley controlled by brain activity. I applied digital filtering to reduce electromagnetic noise and implemented signal modeling for reliable motion control. Beyond the technical challenge, it was my first encounter with translating human intention into machine action. The project inspired my lasting interest in how technology can extend cognition and human capability.

## 🌬️ Wind Farm Dispatch and Power Allocation  
*2020, Beijing Jiaotong University*  

The project focused on developing multi-dimensional evaluation metrics for coordinated dispatch of wind farm clusters. By integrating grid topology, equipment performance, and output forecasting, I designed strategies for improving utilization and reliability. It was through this project that I learned optimization is not about perfection but about balance, and that system stability often depends on carefully negotiated trade-offs.
