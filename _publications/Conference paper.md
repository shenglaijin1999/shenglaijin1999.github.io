excerpt: 'A Swedish case study integrating transport and energy systems to assess grid impact and infrastructure needs for nationwide electromobility. This paper presents a **Swedish transport–energy integration model** linking vehicle electrification pathways with grid demand. Traffic flow data, battery consumption statistics, and Monte Carlo simulations were used to quantify charging demand and power system impacts across four Swedish energy zones (SE1–SE4). Results highlight regional imbalances and propose optimized infrastructure placement for large-scale EV adoption.'
